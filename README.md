  From the same link above download the dataset.

  I found out that, I was not able to compile pytorch transfer learning tutorial code on my machine. There were many bugs in the                         code, even there was no proper type casting into integer for array indexes. 


# So, I have fixed it and it's now running perfectly on my Machine
