# Bugs fixed in TRANSFER-LEARNING TUTORIAL https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html
# From the same link above download the dataset.

# I found out that, I was not able to compile pytorch transfer learning tutorial code on my machine. There were many bugs in the   # code, even there was no proper type casting into integer for array indexes. 


# So, I have fixed it and it is Now running perfectly on my Machine
# Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
# NVIDIA: 1050Ti
# IDE: Pycharm 2018.1.1 Community Edition. 
# Python 3.6.4 |Anaconda custom (64-bit)|
# The Code Only runs on cuda machines only. 



# Please change the dataset URI, where you have placed data-set 
# In this source code this the 
data_dir = '/home/thaqafi/PycharmProjects/transfer_learning/hymenoptera'
